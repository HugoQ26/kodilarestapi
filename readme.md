# Order a ticket for concert.

##### Tech stack: Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io, React.js

#### My job was to make:

1. a REST api for the frontend
2. use that api in the React's frontend and all the logic
3. use in some cases socket.io

Deployed on [heroku.](https://concertsrest.herokuapp.com/ 'Book a ticket for a concert.')

#### Installation

First clone repo.

Next in root folder:

`npm run inst_dep` - this will install all dependiences , both client and server side.

And then run:

`npm run dev` - this will start Node server and React app concurrently.

And in the browser:

`http://localhost:3000/`
